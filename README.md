# Signal Denoising Using a New Class of Robust
Neural Networks 

## Introduction 

We propose a novel neural network architecture, called Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network
(ACNN), which can be viewed as an intermediate solution
between a standard convolutional network and a fully connected
one. A constrained training strategy is developed to learn the
parameters of such a network. The proposed algorithm allows
us to control the Lipschitz constant of our ACNN to secure its
robustness to adversarial noise. The resulting learning approach
is evaluated for signal denoising based on a database of music
recordings. Both qualitative and quantitative results show that
the designed network is successful in removing Gaussian noise
with unknown variance.
